# CapsuleMove
 Multiplayer moving objects for Windows and Quest2


This is a proof of concept project combining the multiplayer movement of Netcode for Game Objects with Sam's InputListener.cs for use with Quest2 headset.  It can be compiled for Windows or Oculus.  Button or key A starts it as a Host, while button or key B starts it as a client.  Then keyboard keys A,S,D and W move the capsule in Windows, and the right joystick moves it in Quest2.
